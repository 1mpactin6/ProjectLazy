<![if !supportLists]>2.       <![endif]>**Time Management**:
 
<![if !supportLists]>a.       <![endif]>Finish the main codes and research about IXL by March
 
<![if !supportLists]>b.       <![endif]>Finish the main hack code or auto-answer by May
 
<![if !supportLists]>c.       <![endif]>Finalize the codes and publish the repository by July
